## Description
The `mapToDtoEmployee` function is used to map an employee object to a DTO (Data Transfer Object) representation of the employee. This function is typically used in the context of an employee management system to convert employee entities to a format that can be easily transferred between different layers of the application.

## Parameters
- `employee`: The employee object that needs to be mapped to a DTO representation.

## Usage Example
```java
Employee employee = new Employee("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com", "Manager");
EmployeeDto employeeDto = mapToDtoEmployee(employee);
System.out.println(employeeDto.getName()); // Output: John Doe
System.out.println(employeeDto.getEmail()); // Output: john.doe@example.com
System.out.println(employeeDto.getPosition()); // Output: Manager
```

## Important Notes
- This function assumes that the `Employee` class and `EmployeeDto` class have appropriate getters and setters for the required fields.
- It is important to ensure that the mapping logic in this function is correctly implemented to avoid any data loss or inconsistencies in the DTO representation.\n\n---\n\n
